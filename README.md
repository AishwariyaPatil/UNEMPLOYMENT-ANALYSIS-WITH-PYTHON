# Unemployment Analysis with Python

This project focuses on analyzing unemployment data using Python. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis is performed using Google Colab.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's unemployment dataset. It includes historical unemployment data, along with relevant attributes like Region	 Date	 Frequency	 Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)	 Estimated Employed	 Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)	Area.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Google Colab account or environment set up
- Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy installed (these are typically available by default in Google Colab)

## Usage

1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.

2. Upload the unemployment dataset (CSV file) to your Google Colab environment. You can do this by clicking on the file icon in the sidebar and selecting the dataset file from your local machine.

3. In your Colab notebook, import the necessary Python libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy.

4. Load the dataset using pandas and explore its contents to understand the structure of the data.

5. Perform data preprocessing tasks like handling missing values, data cleaning, and data transformation as needed.

6. Conduct various data analyses, such as visualizing unemployment trends over time, comparing unemployment rates between different regions or demographic groups, etc.

7. Generate insightful visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to present the analysis results.

8. Draw conclusions from the analysis and discuss any significant findings.

9. Save the Colab notebook with the analysis and visualizations for future reference.
